---

## 4. 📆 Booking Management

### Booking Creation
- Guests can book a property for specified dates.
- Prevent double bookings using date validation.

### Booking Cancellation
- Allow guests or hosts to cancel bookings based on the cancellation policy.

### Booking Status
- Track booking statuses:
  - Pending
  - Confirmed
  - Canceled
  - Completed

---

## 5. 💳 Payment Integration

- Implement secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle:
  - Upfront payments by guests
  - Automatic payouts to hosts after a booking is completed
- Include support for multiple currencies.

---

## 6. 🌟 Reviews and Ratings

- Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- Hosts can respond to reviews.
- Ensure reviews are linked to specific bookings to prevent abuse.

---

## 7. 🔔 Notifications System

- Implement email and in-app notifications for:
  - Booking confirmations
  - Cancellations
  - Payment updates

---

## 8. 🛠️ Admin Dashboard

- Create an admin interface for monitoring and managing:
  - Users
  - Listings
  - Bookings
  - Payments

---

# 🛠️ Technical Requirements

## 1. 🗃️ Database Management

- Use a relational database such as **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**.
- Required tables:
  - Users (guests and hosts)
  - Properties
  - Bookings
  - Reviews
  - Payments

---

## 2. 🌐 API Development

- Use **RESTful APIs** to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.
- Include proper HTTP methods and status codes:
  - `GET` (retrieve data)
  - `POST` (create data)
  - `PUT/PATCH` (update data)
  - `DELETE` (remove data)
- Use **GraphQL** for complex data fetching scenarios *(optional but recommended)*.

---

## 3. 🔐 Authentication and Authorization

- Use **JWT** for secure user sessions.
- Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to differentiate permissions for:
  - Guests
  - Hosts
  - Admins

---

## 4. 🖼️ File Storage

- Store property images and user profile photos in cloud storage solutions such as **AWS S3** or **Cloudinary**.
- For this implementation, we will use **local file storage**.

## 5. 📧 Third-Party Services

- Use email services like **SendGrid** or **Mailgun** for email notifications.

---

## 6. ⚠️ Error Handling and Logging

- Implement global error handling for APIs.
- Log all critical errors and activities for audit and debugging.

---

# 🚀 Non-Functional Requirements

## 1. ⚙️ Scalability

- Use a modular architecture to ensure the app scales as traffic increases.
- Enable horizontal scaling using **load balancers**.

---

## 2. 🔐 Security

- Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using **encryption**.
- Implement **firewalls** and **rate limiting** to prevent malicious activities.

---

## 3. ⚡ Performance Optimization

- Use caching tools like **Redis** to improve response times for frequently accessed data.
- Optimize **database queries** to reduce server load.

---

## 4. 🧪 Testing

- Implement **unit and integration tests** using frameworks like `pytest`.
- Include **automated API testing** to ensure endpoints function as expected.
