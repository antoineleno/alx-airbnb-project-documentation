# 🏡 Airbnb Clone – Backend System Architecture Documentation

Welcome to the documentation repository for the **Airbnb Clone Backend**. This repository outlines the foundational planning, system architecture, and technical specifications for the backend services of an Airbnb-like property rental platform. This documentation is intended for backend developers, system architects, QA engineers, and stakeholders involved in building the platform.

---

## 📁 Repository Overview

This repository contains the following core artifacts:

- Feature documentation
- Use case analysis
- User stories
- Data flow and process modeling
- Technical specifications

Each section provides diagrams and structured markdown documentation to guide backend development.

---

## 🔧 Features & Functionalities

Directory: [`features-and-functionalities/`](./features-and-functionalities)

This section contains a visual overview of the major features supported by the backend system. These include:

- 🔐 **User Authentication**: Account registration, login, and session management
- 🏠 **Property Management**: Create, update, and delete property listings
- 📅 **Booking System**: Search availability, request bookings, and confirm reservations
- 💳 **Payment Integration**: Process payments securely via third-party gateways
- 📬 **Messaging**: User-to-user communication about bookings
- 🧾 **Review System**: Hosts and guests can leave ratings and reviews

> Refer to the diagram [`features.png`](./features-and-functionalities/Airbnb_clone_backend_features_diagram.png) for a high-level breakdown.

---

## 🎭 Use Case Diagram

Directory: [`use-case-diagram/`](./use-case-diagram)

This section includes a **Use Case Diagram** that illustrates the interactions between primary actors (Users, Hosts, and Admins) and the backend system. It identifies essential use cases such as:

- Registering as a user or host
- Listing or managing a property
- Booking a stay
- Making payments
- Leaving reviews

> View the [`AirBnB_UseCase_Diagram.png`](./use-case-diagram/AirBnB_UseCase_Diagram.png) for the full diagram.

---

## 🧑‍💻 User Stories

Directory: [`user-stories/`](./user-stories)

This section translates use case interactions into real-world user stories to guide development and testing. These stories help capture the needs of both guests and hosts, such as:

- *As a host, I want to list my apartment so that users can book it.*
- *As a user, I want to filter listings by date and price so I can find available homes.*

> See [`user-stories.md`](./user-stories/user-stories.md) for the full list of user stories.

---

## 🔄 Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

Directory: [`data-flow-diagram/`](./data-flow-diagram)

This section visualizes the **data movement** within the backend system using a **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**. It includes entities such as:

- External Users (Guests and Hosts)
- The Backend API
- The Database Layer
- Third-party services (e.g., payment processors)

> The diagram [`data-flow.png`](./data-flow-diagram/data-flow.png) illustrates how data flows from user input to backend processing and storage.

---

## 🔁 Flowcharts

Directory: [`flowcharts/`](./flowcharts)

This section focuses on the process flow for key backend operations. The documented flowchart outlines the steps involved in a **property booking** scenario, from request initiation to payment confirmation.

> Visual reference: [`data-flow-diagram.png`](./flowcharts/data-flow-diagram.png)

## 📄 Requirements Specifications

File: [`requirements.md`](./requirements.md)

This document contains detailed functional and technical specifications for three of the most critical backend modules:

1. **User Authentication**
   - REST API endpoints
   - Token-based sessions
   - Input validation and error handling

2. **Property Management**
   - CRUD operations for listings
   - Ownership validation
   - Search filters

3. **Booking System**
   - Booking requests and approval flow
   - Availability checking
   - Payment pre-processing and confirmation

Each section includes:
- Endpoint definitions
- HTTP method & status codes
- Request/response payloads
- Validation rules
- Performance considerations
